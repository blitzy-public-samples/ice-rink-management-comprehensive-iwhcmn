This implementation does the following:

1. Imports all types from the domain-specific type files (user, booking, rink, and equipment).
2. Re-exports all types from these files.
3. Creates namespaces for each domain to allow for more organized type usage.
4. Defines additional shared types that might be used across the application, such as `Pagination`, `ApiResponse`, `ID`, and `Timestamp`.
5. Includes TODO comments for the pending human tasks mentioned in the specification.

Note that we've made assumptions about the existence and content of the imported files (user.ts, booking.ts, rink.ts, and equipment.ts). These files should be created and populated with their respective type definitions.

The structure allows for easy import of types in other parts of the application, like this:

```typescript
import { User, Booking, Rink, Equipment, ApiResponse, ID } from '@/shared/types';
