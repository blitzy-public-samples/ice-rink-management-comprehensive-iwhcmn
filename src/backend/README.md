# Ice Rink Management and Booking System - Backend Service

## Introduction

This is the backend service for the Ice Rink Management and Booking System. It provides a robust and scalable API to support the management of ice rinks, bookings, equipment, and user data.

## Getting Started

To set up the development environment and run the backend service locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `src/backend` directory
3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```
4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in the required environment variables
5. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

## Project Structure

The backend service is organized as follows:

- `src/`: Source code directory
  - `types/`: TypeScript type definitions
  - `utils/`: Utility functions
  - `config/`: Configuration files
  - `db/`: Database-related files (migrations, seeders)
  - `integrations/`: Third-party service integrations
  - `services/`: Core business logic services
  - `jobs/`: Background jobs and scheduled tasks
  - `scripts/`: Utility scripts
- `tests/`: Test files
- `index.ts`: Main application entry point

## Configuration

The backend service uses environment variables for configuration. Key configuration files:

- `src/config/index.ts`: Main configuration file
- `src/config/database.ts`: Database configuration
- `src/config/redis.ts`: Redis configuration
- `src/config/aws.ts`: AWS services configuration

Ensure all required environment variables are set in the `.env` file before running the service.

## API Documentation

API documentation is available via Swagger. Once the server is running, you can access the API documentation at:

```
http://localhost:<PORT>/api-docs
```

Replace `<PORT>` with the port number specified in your environment configuration.

## Database

The service uses PostgreSQL as the primary database. Database-related files:

- Migrations: `src/db/migrations/`
- Seeders: `src/db/seeders/`

To run migrations:
```
npm run migrate
```

To seed the database:
```
npm run seed
```

## Services

The backend provides the following core services:

- Cache Service: `src/services/cacheService.ts`
- Notification Service: `src/services/notificationService.ts`
- Reporting Service: `src/services/reportingService.ts`
- Analytics Service: `src/services/analyticsService.ts`
- Maintenance Service: `src/services/maintenanceService.ts`
- Scheduler Service: `src/services/schedulerService.ts`
- File Storage Service: `src/services/fileStorageService.ts`

## Jobs

Background jobs and scheduled tasks:

- Daily Report Job: `src/jobs/dailyReportJob.ts`
- Maintenance Reminder Job: `src/jobs/maintenanceReminderJob.ts`
- Data Cleanup Job: `src/jobs/dataCleanupJob.ts`

## Integrations

The backend integrates with the following third-party services:

- Stripe: Payment processing
- SendGrid: Email service
- Twilio: SMS notifications
- Google Maps: Location services
- Firebase: Push notifications
- Sentry: Error tracking and monitoring

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```
npm run test
```

The test files are located in the `tests/` directory, organized by test type (unit, integration) and component.

## Deployment

The deployment process is managed through CI/CD pipelines. For manual deployment, follow these steps:

1. Ensure all environment variables are correctly set for the target environment
2. Build the application:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
3. Start the production server:
   ```
   npm run start:prod
   ```

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and their solutions:

1. Database connection errors:
   - Check database credentials in the `.env` file
   - Ensure the database server is running and accessible

2. Redis connection issues:
   - Verify Redis connection settings in the `.env` file
   - Check if the Redis server is running

3. API rate limiting errors:
   - Adjust rate limiting settings in the configuration if necessary

For more specific issues, consult the error logs or contact the development team.
