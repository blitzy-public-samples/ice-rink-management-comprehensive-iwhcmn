We are developing a comprehensive software solution to completely revolutionize ice rink management and booking processes. The goal is to create an all-encompassing platform that will replace existing solutions like RecTimes, addressing the complex needs of ice rink operations and pricing.

The software needs to handle various types of ice availability, including:
- Season-long bookings for local teams
- Public skates open to anyone
- Adult hockey leagues
- Drop-in hockey sessions
- Drop-in figure skating
- Split slots for multiple simultaneous lessons

It should also accommodate different pricing models such as:
- Time-based (e.g., 50-minute or 80-minute slots)
- Ice area-based (full sheet, half ice, eighth of the ice)

The comprehensive system of record should include the following components:
1. Internal scheduling system
2. External-facing booking functionality
3. Cross-channel marketing campaign management
4. On-ice insurance integration
5. Lending services
6. Payroll management
7. Procurement and inventory management
8. Ad marketplace

Key features to implement:
- Real-time availability tracking and updates
- Automated pricing based on various factors (time, ice area, season, etc.)
- Secure online payment processing
- User profiles for frequent bookers (coaches, teams, leagues)
- Comprehensive reporting and analytics for rink managers
- Mobile-friendly interface for on-the-go bookings
- Integration with popular calendar applications
- Automated notifications for bookings, cancellations, and schedule changes
- Resource management for equipment and facilities
- Staff scheduling and management
- Integration with point-of-sale systems for pro shops and concessions
- Customer relationship management (CRM) functionality
- Financial reporting and forecasting tools

The solution should be robust, scalable, and highly available. It must offer a complete replacement for existing systems with significantly enhanced features. The user interface should be intuitive for both rink managers and end-users (skaters, coaches, and teams).

The primary goals of this comprehensive system are to:
1. Dramatically reduce the time and effort spent on ice time management
2. Improve utilization of rink resources
3. Enhance the overall experience for both rink operators and ice users
4. Increase revenue through optimized scheduling and pricing
5. Provide valuable insights through data analytics
6. Streamline all aspects of rink operations under a single, integrated platform

This solution aims to be the new industry standard, capable of managing all aspects of ice rink operations efficiently and effectively.
