| Environment | Description | Justification |
|-------------|-------------|---------------|
| Cloud | Primary deployment environment | Offers scalability, high availability, and reduced infrastructure management overhead |
| On-premises | Limited deployment for specific components | May be required for certain data storage or processing needs due to regulatory compliance |
| Hybrid | Combination of cloud and on-premises | Provides flexibility to leverage cloud benefits while maintaining control over sensitive operations |

## 7.2 CLOUD SERVICES

The system will utilize Amazon Web Services (AWS) as the primary cloud service provider due to its comprehensive service offerings, global presence, and robust security features.

| AWS Service | Purpose | Justification |
|-------------|---------|---------------|
| Amazon EC2 | Compute instances for application servers | Scalable and flexible compute capacity |
| Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL | Managed database service | Simplifies database administration and scaling |
| Amazon ElastiCache for Redis | In-memory caching | Improves application performance |
| Amazon S3 | Object storage for files and backups | Durable and cost-effective storage solution |
| Amazon CloudFront | Content Delivery Network (CDN) | Improves global content delivery and reduces latency |
| AWS Lambda | Serverless compute for specific functions | Enables event-driven architecture and reduces operational complexity |
| Amazon SQS | Message queuing service | Facilitates decoupling of system components |
| AWS Elastic Beanstalk | Application deployment and management | Simplifies deployment and scaling of web applications |

## 7.3 CONTAINERIZATION

The Ice Rink Management and Booking System will utilize Docker for containerization to ensure consistency across development, testing, and production environments.

```mermaid

    A[Application Code] --> B[Docker Image]
    B --> C[Development Container]
    B --> D[Testing Container]
    B --> E[Production Container]
    F[Base Image] --> B
    G[Dependencies] --> B
```

Key benefits of using Docker:
1. Consistency across environments
2. Improved developer productivity
3. Efficient resource utilization
4. Simplified deployment and scaling

## 7.4 ORCHESTRATION

Kubernetes will be used for container orchestration to manage the deployment, scaling, and operations of application containers across clusters of hosts.

```mermaid

    A[Kubernetes Cluster] --> B[Master Node]
    A --> C[Worker Node 1]
    A --> D[Worker Node 2]
    A --> E[Worker Node N]
    B --> F[API Server]
    B --> G[Scheduler]
    B --> H[Controller Manager]
    B --> I[etcd]
    C --> J[kubelet]
    C --> K[kube-proxy]
    C --> L[Container Runtime]
```

Key features of Kubernetes orchestration:
1. Automated rollouts and rollbacks
2. Self-healing capabilities
3. Horizontal scaling
4. Service discovery and load balancing
5. Secret and configuration management

## 7.5 CI/CD PIPELINE

The continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline will be implemented using AWS CodePipeline in conjunction with other AWS services to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Code Repository] --> B[AWS CodePipeline]
    B --> C[AWS CodeBuild]
    C --> D[Unit Tests]
    D --> E[Integration Tests]
    E --> F[AWS CodeDeploy]
    F --> G[Staging Environment]
    G --> H[Manual Approval]
    H --> I[Production Environment]
```

| Stage | Tool/Service | Purpose |
|-------|--------------|---------|
| Source Control | GitHub | Version control and collaboration |
| CI/CD Orchestration | AWS CodePipeline | Manage and visualize the entire CI/CD workflow |
| Build | AWS CodeBuild | Compile source code, run tests, and produce deployment artifacts |
| Testing | Jest, Selenium | Automated unit and integration testing |
| Deployment | AWS CodeDeploy | Automate application deployments to EC2 instances or ECS |
| Infrastructure as Code | AWS CloudFormation | Define and provision AWS infrastructure resources |
| Monitoring | AWS CloudWatch | Monitor application and infrastructure performance |

Key features of the CI/CD pipeline:
1. Automated builds triggered by code commits
2. Comprehensive testing at multiple stages
3. Staged deployments (development, staging, production)
4. Automated rollbacks in case of deployment failures
5. Integration with monitoring and alerting systems

This infrastructure setup ensures a robust, scalable, and maintainable deployment environment for the Ice Rink Management and Booking System, leveraging cloud services, containerization, and modern DevOps practices to streamline development and operations.
