# Ice Rink Management and Booking System API

## Overview

This is the API for the Ice Rink Management and Booking System, a comprehensive solution designed to streamline the management and operation of ice rinks. The API provides endpoints for scheduling, booking, financial management, customer relationship management, and facility maintenance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this API, you'll need the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js (v14 or later)
- npm (v6 or later)
- PostgreSQL (v12 or later)
- Redis (v6 or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/ice-rink-management-api.git
   cd ice-rink-management-api
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Set up the database:
   - Create a PostgreSQL database for the project
   - Run the database migrations (see Database section below)

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`
   - Fill in the required environment variables (see Environment Variables section below)

5. Start the server:
   ```
   npm run start
   ```

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following variables:

```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/database_name
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

Adjust the values according to your local setup.

```

This provides an interactive interface to explore and test all available API endpoints.

## Database

### Migrations

To run database migrations:

```
npm run migrate
```

To create a new migration:

```
npm run migrate:create -- --name your_migration_name
```

### Seed Data

To seed the database with initial data:

```
npm run seed
```

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```
npm run test
```

This will run both unit and integration tests. Make sure you have a test database set up and configured in your `.env.test` file.

## Deployment

The API is designed to be deployed to a cloud environment such as AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Detailed deployment instructions will depend on your specific cloud provider and infrastructure setup.

General steps for deployment:

1. Set up a production database
2. Configure environment variables for the production environment
3. Build the TypeScript files: `npm run build`
4. Start the server: `npm run start`

For more specific deployment instructions, please refer to your cloud provider's documentation or consult with your DevOps team.
