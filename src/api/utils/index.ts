import * as validation from './validation';

// Export utility modules

// For example:
// export const log = logger.log;
// export const encrypt = encryption.encrypt;
// export const validateEmail = validation.validateEmail;

/**
 * @fileoverview
 * This index file centralizes the export of utility functions used throughout the API.
 * By importing from this file, other parts of the application can easily access
 * logging, encryption, and validation utilities without having to import from
 * multiple files.
 * 
 * Usage example:
 * import { logger, encryption, validation } from '../utils';
 * 
 * logger.info('This is a log message');
 * const encryptedData = encryption.encrypt(sensitiveData);
 * const isValid = validation.validateInput(userInput);

/**
 * Pending Human Tasks:
 * 1. Implement logger utility in src/api/utils/logger.ts (Required)
 * 2. Implement encryption utility in src/api/utils/encryption.ts (Required)
 * 3. Implement validation utility in src/api/utils/validation.ts (Required)
